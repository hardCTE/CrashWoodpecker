A Uncaught Exception Handler library like as Square's [LeakCanary](https://github.com/square/leakcanary).

## Getting started

In your `build.gradle`:

```gradle
  //I uploaded it in 21:03 Set 2, so that it may not take effect in maven, please waiting for a moment.
  dependencies {
   debugCompile 'me.drakeet.library:crashwoodpechker:0.9'
  }
```

In your `Application` class:

```java
public class ExampleApplication extends Application {

  @Override public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();
    CrashWoodpecker.fly().to(this);
  }
}
```

**That is all!** CrashWoodpecker will automatically show a Activity when your app crash with uncaught exceptions in your debug build.
